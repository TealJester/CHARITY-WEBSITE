                                                                      2. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
This System Analysis is closely related to requirements analysis. It is also "an explicit formal
inquiry carried out to help someone (referred to as the decision maker) identify a better course
of action and make a better decision than he might otherwise have made." This step involves
breaking down the system in different pieces to analyze the situation, analyzing project goals,
breaking down what needs to be created and attempting to engage users so that definite
requirements can be defined


              Databases Intro
• Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits 
• Sometimes, you want to store data in a database…
• You can structure the data
• You build indexes to efficiently query / search through the data
• You define relationships between your datasets
• Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different 
features, shapes and constraint



Databases & Shared Responsibility on AWS
• AWS offers use to manage different databases
• Benefits include:
• Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
• Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades
• Operating System Patching is handled by AWS
• Monitoring, alerting
• Note: many databases technologies could be run on EC2, but you must 
handle yourself the resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault 
tolerance, scaling…




AWS RDS Overview 
• RDS stands for Relational Database Service
• It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language. 
• It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
• Postgres
• MySQL
• MariaDB
• Oracle
• Microsoft SQL Server
• Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)



Advantage over using RDS versus deploying 
DB on EC2
• RDS is a managed service:
• Automated provisioning, OS patching
• Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
• Monitoring dashboards
• Read replicas for improved read performance
• Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
• Maintenance windows for upgrades
• Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
• Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
• BUT you can’t SSH into your instance





DynamoDB 
• Fully Managed Highly available with replication across 3 AZ
• NoSQL database - not a relational database 
• Scales to massive workloads, distributed “serverless” database
• Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB of storage
• Fast and consistent in performance 
• Single-digit millisecond latency – low latency retrieval
• Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
• Low cost and auto scaling capabilities
• Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class
